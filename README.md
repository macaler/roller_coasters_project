# roller_coasters_project

This was one of a few Codecademy challenge projects that I completed. I was given some data about roller coaster rankings (as compiled by the Golden Ticket Awards at goldenticketawards.com) and roller coaster statistics (as compiled by Captain Coaster at captaincoaster.com/en/), and a few prompts for functions to write that would allow visualization of various metrics and statistics. I also thought of a few questions of my own and attempted to answer those in my code.

It's not clear to me whether any of this data is proprietary or not, so out of an abundance of caution I'm not including it in this repository. However, I am including my Python 3.8 code so that you can see my coding process and how the functions I wrote were called. This has the distinct disadvantage of not actually showing any output of any of the function calls, so my goal for version 2.0 will be to convert the .py code to a Jupyter Notebook. (I will keep the .py code as well if the Jupyter Notebook is uploaded.)

I used Python 3.8 to complete this project; packages called include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
